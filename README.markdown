Herein lies the code that powers [Nathan Hoad .net](http://nathanhoad.net).

The app is simple - it, with the help of [Maneki](http://github.com/nathanhoad/maneki/), grabs Markdown documents from disk, parses them for meta-data, and serves them up. My reasoning is that TextMate is great for writing articles and Git is great for keeping things organised. Throw Ruby and Sinatra into the mix and you have all the ingredients for something awesome :-)

If you want to use this code for your own app or have any suggestions then [let me know](http://twitter.com/nathanhoad).

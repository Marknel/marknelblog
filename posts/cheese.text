I decided to give [Cheese](http://live.gnome.org/Cheese) another go the other day. Last time I tried it was just after I got my Eye-toy working in [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) but, back then, Cheese didn't seem to play nice. This time, however, things were different.

I installed the latest version (0.2.4) from [GetDeb.net](http://www.getdeb.net) and fired it up. The Eye-toy was picked up first go :-)

Although it is still lacking slightly compared to its inspiration, Photobooth, Cheese is certainly a great piece of software. It comes with a whole bunch of different effects that you can play with.

It is also possible to stack the effects to create crazy new creations.

# Ubuntu Brainstorm

Ubuntu launched its new [feedback site](http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/) the other day. Brainstorm sites seem to be growing in popularity recently with [Dell's Ideastorm](http://www.dellideastorm.com/) site and [GIMP's UI Brainstorm](http://gimp-brainstorm.blogspot.com/) blog proving to be useful in getting quality ideas from the people who use their products.

After looking through some of the ideas I found that one suggestion of mine had [already been raised](http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/240/). Previews of images in the Gnome open dialog  is something that seemed obvious but had yet to be implemented until now (it's going to be in Hardy).

I think one of the best ways to design a product for users is to know what they want, and asking them what they want is a good way to start ;-).

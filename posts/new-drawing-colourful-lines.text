I felt that I needed a new wallpaper (it's been a while since my last one). I wanted to feature some sort of colourful swirly pattern so I set about creating [Colourful Lines](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Colourful-lines-127409006), the latest addition to my [Deviant Art gallery](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com).

Like most of my designs, Colourful Lines was created using Inkscape.

I just uploaded some new art onto my [Deviant Art profile](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com).

I was having a play with my Wacom a few days ago and started drawing a dragon. Since then I have been adding touches to it here and there whenever I got bored of other things. I had been working on a background for the dragon to sit on but I thought I'd upload it as it was for now.

Hope you like it ;-)

[Nigel McBryde](/the-watcher), a graphic designer friend of mine, has thrown [his new design blog](http://nigel.mcbryde.com.au) up on the net.

Nigel's site will be an ever growing collection of designs and design tools. Whether you are into Photoshop, Illustrator, Inkscape, or whatever, it will be a site to keep an eye on ;-).

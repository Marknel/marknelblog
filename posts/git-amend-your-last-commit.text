# Git: Amend your last commit

Git has a number of awesome features; Not least of all is the ability to amend the previous commit. If you ever find that you accidentally left something out of your last commit, be it a file or an extra change to a file that you just committed, don't worry. It can easily be fixed :-D

All you have to do is stage the extra changes like you would for a normal commit:

    git add .

And then just commit with the `--amend` argument.

    git commit --amend

If you don't specify a commit message with `-m` you will be prompted with the previous commit message as a default.

When you're done you can check `git log --stat` to see your amended commit with the extra changes. For more information, check out [Git's 'commit' documentation](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html).

Hope that was helpful.

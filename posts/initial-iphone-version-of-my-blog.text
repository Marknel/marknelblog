# Initial iPhone version of my blog

I just put up an iPhone optimised version of this blog at [iphone.nathanhoad.net](http://iphone.nathanhoad.net). For this early version I have only included basic post reading but intend on eventually including all of the functionality of the full site.

At the moment, the iPhone version is only available from the separate `iphone` subdomain but once I have recreated the rest of the site I think I might just automatically switch to the iPhone version upon detection of Mobile Safari.

Only 1 year to go until **Kristen and I get Married!!!** Now that we have broken the year mark, time should fly until the big day :-P.

I drew up the graphic above as part of a wedding site we are making for our guests (our theme for the wedding in winter... even if it is summer in December in Australia). The penguins are SVG, made in Inkscape, so I might make up a wedding wallpaper and put them up on [Deviant Art](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/).

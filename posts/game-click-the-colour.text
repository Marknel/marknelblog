Click the Colour is a game based on the [Stroop Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) that I made back in college. I was taking a subject in Psychology at the time and, after hearing about the Stroop Effect, thought that it would make a great game concept.

Building the game itself was simple and after a short while I had this:

<object data="http://labs.nathanhoad.net/games/click-the-colour/click-the-colour.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300"><param name="movie" value="http://labs.nathanhoad.net/games/click-the-colour/click-the-colour.swf" /></object>

I'm thinking that I'll revisit the concept eventually and develop the game further. [Let me know what you think](http://twitter.com/home?status=@nathanhoad).

I have posted up two new graphic designs to my [Deviant Art profile](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com).

[![Hero](http://th05.deviantart.com/fs23/300W/f/2008/005/4/5/Hero_by_nathanhoad.png):center](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Hero-73893311)

The first I posted this morning after drawing it up last night. I'm not sure where the idea came from but I felt like drawing a super hero standing atop a building during a storm... so that is what I drew. He was drawn in Inkscape over the course of about an hour. I had several versions of the drawing over that time (one of which has a bat-symbol style torch in the clouds) but I settled on [this one](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Hero-73893311).

[![Eye of eternity](http://th01.deviantart.com/fs24/300W/f/2008/005/5/b/Eye_of_Eternity_by_nathanhoad.png):center](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Eye-of-Eternity-73920079)

This one I drew after seeing [this piece of work](http://pilpls.deviantart.com/art/Greenie-70354835) by Pilpls. His drawing was bright and happy so I wanted to see what I could do with a similar drawing but with a dark and mysterious feel. The result was [Eye of Eternity](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Eye-of-Eternity-73920079), drawn in GIMP with my Wacom.

Well the new [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) is out. It's 7.10 or 'Gutsy Gibbon' for those of you playing at home. There are [quite a number of tweaks and changes](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710tour) in this release. After a quick download I had my copy ready for me to burn and install it. However, I did neither. As a rather unfortunate coincidence, each October release of Ubuntu seems to coincide with my uni exams and I know that if I install Gutsy now, it will be way too easy for me to procrastinate and not get my study done.

What I do find it handy, though, is that if I pre-order a [Shipit](https://shipit.ubuntu.com/) CD of Ubuntu it seems to arrive on my doorstep right in time for the last exam. It makes for a nice reward to finishing uni for another year ;-)

# How to: Focus follows mouse in X11 on Snow Leopard

If you're on a Mac and use any multi-window X11 application (Inkscape and Gimp being just two examples) then you have probably cursed X11's requirement of focusing a floating window before it becomes active. A simple work around is to enable 'focus follows mouse' mode in X11. Just open Terminal and enter this:

    defaults write org.x.X11 wm_ffm -bool true

Then restart X11 and now the focus should be following your mouse pointer, meaning no more double clicking floating windows :-)

To turn 'focus follows mouse' mode off simply change the `true` to `false`:

    defaults write org.x.X11 wm_ffm -bool false

If you want to see the file where these settings are actually written to then type:

    open ~/Library/Preferences/org.x.X11.plist

I hope you find this as useful as I did - Inkscape is awesome but that's one thing that has always bugged me :-P

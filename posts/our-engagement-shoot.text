It's about 43 days until [Kristen](http://maclawstudent.blogspot.com) and I get married. Time is flying. We had our engagement shoot back on the 12th with [Ben Rugers](http://www.infinitystudiosblog.com.au/2008/10/kristen-nathans-engagement-shoot.html) and have just got some of them back. Ben did an awesome job; The photos came out great :-D.

# How to: Valid XHTML and RSS with Youtube

When I was building this blog I came across an interesting problem. I wanted to include some of my video projects as Youtube clips but noticed that the default embed code that Youtube offers isn't valid XHTML.

 Youtube offers something like this:

    #! HTML
    <object width="425" height="350">
      <param name="movie" 
      value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJ6JjzfZ2PM"></param>
      <param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param>
      <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJ6JjzfZ2PM"
        type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
        wmode="transparent"
        width="425"
        height="350"></embed>
    </object>

After a bit of playing around, I found that what I really needed was something more like this:

    #! HTML
    <object data="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJ6JjzfZ2PM" 
      type="application/x-shockwave-flash" 
      width="425" height="350">
      <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJ6JjzfZ2PM"/>
    </object>

The next hurdle was RSS; Valid RSS doesn't allow `<embed>` tags at all. I removed them from the output of my RSS generator but I still wanted to show some sort of preview of the missing Youtube embed. Thankfully, Youtube offers a default preview image for all uploaded videos and so given __iJ6JjzfZ2PM__ as an example video id, the image would be: `http://img.youtube.com/vi/iJ6JjzfZ2PM/default.jpg`

That image comes out something like this:

![Preview image](http://img.youtube.com/vi/iJ6JjzfZ2PM/default.jpg):center

So with all that sorted, now I can have my Youtube and my validation ;-).

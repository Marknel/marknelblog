# Lazy OpenID providing

Single-signon services are growing in popularity. [OpenID](http://openid.net/) is one of the more popular and probably one of the most widely offered of these services. There are a number of providers (eg. if you have a gmail account, then you have an OpenID account). If you want a more personal touch and want your own site to be your identity on the web then you are in luck, because it is as simple as signing up to [MyOpenID](https://www.myopenid.com/) and adding two lines to the `<head>` of your `html`.

Once you have your [MyOpenID](https://www.myopenid.com/) account, copy this into the `<head>` of your template (altering it to suit your account):

    #! HTML
    <link rel="openid.server" href="http://www.myopenid.com/server" />
    <link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://YOUR_ACCOUNT.myopenid.com" />

For example, my details would be:

    #! HTML
    <link rel="openid.server" href="http://www.myopenid.com/server" />
    <link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://nathanhoad.myopenid.com" />

Now you can sign into any OpenID-enabled site with your own site as the provider. [Try it out at StackOverflow.com](http://www.stackoverflow.com).

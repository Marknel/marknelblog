I find the little chat application that sits in the Facebook status bar pretty handy for sending quick messages to buddies who are online when I am. If you're a user of [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im) like me you might like the idea of being able to use the Facebook chat service from within Pidgin (keeping all your IM accounts in one place :-D). Awesomely enough, you can do just that. All you have to do is grab the Facebook Chat for Pidgin plugin:

    wget http://pidgin-facebookchat.googlecode.com/files/pidgin-facebookchat-1.38.deb

Once that has finished downloading you can then do:

    sudo dpkg -i pidgin-facebookchat-1.38.deb

Now a bit of tidying up:

    rm pidgin-facebookchat-1.38.deb

After you restart Pidgin you will have a Facebook option in your Add Account dialog.

Done and done ;-).

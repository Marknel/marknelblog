I just uploaded a new wallpaper to [Deviant Art profile](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com).

[![Nightbows](http://th05.deviantart.com/fs30/300W/f/2008/068/1/2/Nightbows_by_nathanhoad.png):center](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Nightbows-79489162)

The work, titled ['Nightbows'](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Nightbows-79489162), is a night cityscape wallpaper with a few 'night bows' illuminating the sky. I can't really remember when I drew this. I stumbled across it in my wallpaper list the other day and realised that I hadn't uploaded it yet. Nightbows was drawn in Inkscape.

My recent lack of posts has been for a good reason. In the past month Kristen and I had been finalising everything for our wedding :-D I am thrilled to say that, as of yesterday at around 3:15pm, I can now call [Kristen my wife](http://kristenand.nathanhoad.net).

Everything went precisely to plan - even the weather held off until we were safely inside of the reception venue. Thanks to the awesome talents of Ben and Justine Rugers we have some pretty sexy [professional photos](http://benrugersblog.com.au/2008/12/kristen-nathans-wedding-6th-december-2008/) from the day.

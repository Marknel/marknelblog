Who's that stranger riding his bike along that artistic looking street?

A few days ago I managed to get into one of the photos for [Project 365](http://keithrowell.com/project365). The collection is being photographed by the legendary [Keith Rowell](http://keithrowell.com). For the project Keith must take a new photo every day for a whole year. I might be a little biased but I think this is the best photo yet :-P.

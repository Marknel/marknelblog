Here is another wallpaper for my [Deviant Art gallery](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com). This one is a series of concentric colour wheels that have been offset slightly to give the look of a spiral.

I started playing around with the colour wheel from my last design, [Colourful Lines](/new-design-colourful-lines) without the intention of creating anything. After a bit of moving things around and seeing how they looked I thought I may as well finish something. The result was [Colour Trip](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Colour-trip-127513176).

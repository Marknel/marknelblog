I have a new design in my [Deviant Art gallery](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com). This one is a logo/icon kind of thing for a Scrum-based Project Management tool that [Mark Gandolfo](http://markgandolfo.com.au) is working on. You can [follow the project on Twitter](http://twitter.com/scrumandcola).

The 'Scrum and Cola' title is a play on the drink 'Rum and Cola' and the 'Scrum' project management methodology. I decided to use the idea of the drink as an icon with a Rum bottle and a spirit glass.

A few hours of playing around with my favourite vector editor, Inkscape, and I had a design I was happy with. I showed Mark and he suggested a quick change; the label. My original label for the rum bottle was titled 'Royal Feline' and featured a picture of our cat, Aristoclea. After a short talk with Mark we settled on 'Mercury's Choice' as the brand of rum. It's the details that make all the difference.

Drink up ;-)

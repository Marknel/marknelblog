You probably won't need to do this often (if ever at all) but just in case, here is how to delete a tag from a remote Git repository.

If you have a tag named '12345' then you would just do this:

    git tag -d 12345
    git push origin :refs/tags/12345

That will remove '12345' from the remote repository.
